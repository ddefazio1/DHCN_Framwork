## Abstract
The DHCN proposes a four-phase path from isolated minds to planetary-scale collective intelligence, stabilized by AI.  
- Phase 1: Pre-Link (AI external)  
- Phase 2: Implant-Based (small groups)  
- Phase 3: Field/Quantum (wireless)  
- Phase 4: Distributed Singularity (millions of nodes)
