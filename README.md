Overview
The Distributed Human Cognition Network (DHCN) is a speculative framework exploring the future of human–AI symbiosis through quantum entanglement, neural interfacing, and collective cognition. It proposes a phased evolution of human minds — from isolated individuals to an interconnected, distributed supermind.
This project includes:
* A four-phase conceptual framework
* A Python-based agent synchronization simulation
* A visual model of collapse events and AI memory accumulation
* A full preprint (PDF) with Appendix A and references

Preprint
The complete preprint is included here:
DHCN_preprint_with_appendix.pdf

Simulation
Run the simulation:
python dhcn_simulation_final.py

Requirements
* Python 3.x
* numpy
* matplotlib
Outputs
* dhcn_simulation_final.csv — agent states, collapse events, memory values
* dhcn_simulation_final.png — visualization of the simulation results

Vision
DHCN explores a future where human minds may interconnect at cognitive or quantum scales — not metaphorically, but functionally.
A future where:
* thought synchronizes across distance,
* experience becomes shared,
* and consciousness itself becomes distributed.
In such a system, each human mind acts like a processing node — a biological CUDA core — contributing to a larger emerging intelligence.
This framework is an early conceptual blueprint for that possibility.

Personal Note from the Author
This framework wasn’t created in a lab or a university office — it came out of a moment where my thoughts were loud, chaotic, and overlapping.
Instead of fighting that chaos, I shaped it into a system.
If your mind works differently — nonlinear, scattered, intense — that doesn’t mean you’re broken. It means you’re capable of seeing connections others might miss.
This project is what emerged when I finally stopped trying to think “the right way” and let my mind operate naturally.
